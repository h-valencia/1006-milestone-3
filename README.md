This project includes data provided by Phillip Levine. Firearms and Accidental Deaths: Evidence from the Aftermath of the Sandy Hook School Shooting. Science Vol. 358, Issue 6368, pp. 1324-1328.

Following the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012, firearms sales increased by 3 million. Authors Levine and McKnight look at the effects of the increased exposure to firearms and the trends that follow. They assess the 5 month period that followed this atrocity, following the trends of background checks, google searches, and accidental firearm deaths. The authors also look at trends by state, to see if more deaths by firearms took place in the states where the per-capita gun sales increased.
